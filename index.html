    <p>Barry Allen is the Fastest Man Alive as The Flash.  Ironically living life as a notoriously late forensic scientist, Barry uses his powers of superspeed to thwart evil after being struck by lightning in his chemical lab and discovering himself...faster.  After learning to control his new found powers, he became a hero, being wherever someone was in need of help, in a blink of an eye and a blur of red his from costume, earning him the nickname, The Scarlet Speedster.</p>
    <p>Aside from protecting his hometown of Central City and the neighboring Keystone City, The Flash is a founding member of <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Justice_League">The Justice League</a>, fighting side by side with the likes of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman for justice wherever they are needed.  Barry Allen may not be the only superhero in his world and is one of many that have take the mantle of The Flash, but his hope, strong sense of morality, and determination keep him running forward, separating himself from others.</p>
